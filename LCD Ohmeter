/* The goal of this program is to make a digital ohmmeter. 
 * In this program, the same process as a digital voltmeter 
 * will be done. The Analog pins from the Arduino will be
 * used and the Analog Digital Converter(ADC) and the 
 * built-in libraries for this program. The main theme 
 * in this program is learning how to use the built-in
 * libraries in the Arduino UNO software.
