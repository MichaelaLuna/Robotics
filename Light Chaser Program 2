/* This program is used to create a Light Chaser that goes back and forth using the Arduino UNO Board. 
Using external LED's and connecting them to pin 13,12,11 and 10 to control them together.
Using the command digitalWrite to write a HIGH or LOW value to the digital pins, to open or close the LED's.
Using the command delay to have a time delay during the blinking of LED's which creates the Light Chaser effect.
The main theme is digitalWrite.
