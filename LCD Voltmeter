* The goal of this program is to make a digital voltmeter using
 * an Arduino UNO.In this, the voltages to be measured, which are in 
 * analog form, are converted to digital form with the Analog 
 * to Digital Converters (ADC), a built in in the Arduino UNO which 
 * what we will use in this project. The main theme of this program is 
 * learning how to activate the built in libraries in our Arduino UNO.
