/* The goal of this program is to mix two sensors: DHT11 and the Ultrasonic sensor 
 * and show the value produced in the LCD. Knowing that the Ultrasonic sensor is the 
 * "eye of the tiger", meaning it can be a navigation tool for it can measure distances 
 * using sound waves. With the case of the DHT11 sensor, it is a temperature sensor which 
 * means it can help with getting the accurate value of the distnce since temperature 
 * is a variable in the speed of sound equation. Since this program includes new variables
 * again, it means using the ability to add a library in the software again which is the main
 * theme of this program.
