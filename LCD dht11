/* The goal of this program is to power the sensor DHT11; a sensor that is capable of showing 
 * the temperature and humidity either with the Serial Monitor who is already in the arduino 
 * software or the LCD that will have its pins be wired with the Digital pins in the Arduino 
 * board. Although, there is a specific main goal, doing all the wiring and coding correctly 
 * will not do all the job because the most important step is learning how to add a library 
 * in the software which is the "DHT Sensor Library by Adafruit" which leads me to the main 
 * theme of this program: learning how to add a library to the Arduino IDE.
