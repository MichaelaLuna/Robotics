/* This program is used to turn on and off an LED connected to pin 13 of the Arduino UNO. 
Using the command LED_BUILTIN the internal LED turns on and off.
Using  an external LED and connecting to pin 13 to control them together.
Using the command digitalWrite to write a HIGH or LOW value to the digital pin 13 .
The main theme is digitalWrite.
