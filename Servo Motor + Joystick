/* This program is used to control the Servo Motor using a joystick, an input device 
 * consisting of a stick that pivots on a base and reports its angle or direction to 
 * the device it is controlling. In this program, we will be able to control the direction
 * of the Servo Motor in the X-axis. The main theme of it is knowing how to add a Library
 * and use it and learning how to use the servo.attach() and servo.write() functions.
